PCs are based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip. Businesses use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and database management applications. At home, the most popular use for personal computers is playing games and surfing the Internet.</p> <p>Although personal computers are designed as single-user systems, these systems are normally linked together to form a network. In terms of power, now-a-days high-end models of the Macintosh and PC offer the same computing power and graphics capability as low-end workstations by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.</p> <h2>Workstation</h2> <p>Workstation is a computer used for engineering applications (CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, software development, and other such types of applications which require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high quality graphics capabilities.</p> <p>Workstations generally come with a large, high-resolution graphics screen, large amount of RAM, inbuilt network support, and a graphical user interface. Most workstations also have mass storage device such as a disk drive, but a special type of workstation, called diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive.</p> <p>Common operating systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like PC, workstations are also single-user computers like PC but are typically linked together to form a local-area network, although they can also be used as stand-alone systems.</p> <h2>Minicomputer</h2> <p>It is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting up to 250 users simultaneously.</p> <h2>Mainframe</h2> <p>Mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users simultaneously. Mainframe executes many programs concurrently and supports many simultaneous execution of programs.</p> <h2>Supercomputer</h2> <p>Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently available. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for specialized applications that require immense amount of mathematical calculations (number crunching).</p> <p>For example, weather forecasting, scientific simulations, (animated) graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological data (e.g. in petrochemical prospecting).</p> <style type=\"text/css\"> h2 { color:#1E88E5; } </style>",

Each character printed is in the form of pattern of dots and head consists of a Matrix of Pins of size (5*7, 7*9, 9*7 or 9*9) which come out to form a character which is why it is called Dot Matrix Printer.</p> <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Inexpensive</li> <li>Widely Used</li> <li>Other language characters can be printed</li> </ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Slow Speed</li> <li>Poor Quality</li> </ul> <p><strong>Daisy Wheel</strong></p> <p>Head is lying on a wheel and pins corresponding to characters are like petals of Daisy (flower) which is why it is called Daisy Wheel Printer. These printers are generally used for word-processing in offices that require a few letters to be sent here and there with very nice quality.</p> <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>More reliable than DMP</li> <li>Better quality</li> <li>Fonts of character can be easily changed</li> </ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Slower than DMP</li> <li>Noisy</li> <li>More expensive than DMP</li> </ul> <p><strong>Line Printers</strong></p> <p>Line printers are the printers which print one line at a time.</p> <p>These are of two types &minus;</p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Drum Printer</li> <li>Chain Printer</li> </ul> <p><strong>Drum Printer</strong></p> <p>This printer is like a drum in shape hence it is called drum printer. The surface of the drum is divided into a number of tracks. Total tracks are equal to the size of the paper, i.e. for a paper width of 132 characters, drum will have 132 tracks. A character set is embossed on the track. Different character sets available in the market are 48 character set, 64 and 96 characters set. One rotation of drum prints one line. Drum printers are fast in speed and can print 300 to 2000 lines per minute.</p> <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Very high speed</li> </ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p> <ul class=\"list\"> <li>Very expensive</li> <li>Characters fonts cannot be changed</li> </ul> <p><strong>Chain Printer</strong></p> <p>In this printer, a chain of character sets is used, hence it is called Chain Printer.
